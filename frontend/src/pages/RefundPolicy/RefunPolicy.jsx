                                Last Updated : 10/02/2025 <br /> <br />

                                At Launchpadd , we are committed to providing high-quality programs and resources to empower women entrepreneurs. To ensure fairness and clarity, we have established the following Refund Policy: <br /><br />

                               <h5> 1. No Refunds After Enrollment</h5> <br />

                                Once you enroll in one of our programs (e.g., 1-Month or 3-Month Program), no refunds will be issued under any circumstances. 
                                This policy applies regardless of whether you complete the program, access the materials, or participate in mentorship sessions. <br /> <br /> <br />


                                <h5>2. Cancellation Before Enrollment</h5> <br />

                                If you wish to cancel your enrollment, you must do so before completing the payment process .
                                Once payment is made and enrollment is confirmed, the transaction is final, and no cancellations or refunds are permitted. <br /> <br/> <br />


                                <h5>3. Exceptional Circumstances</h5> <br />

                                While we do not offer refunds, we may consider transferring your enrollment to a future cohort or program in exceptional cases (e.g., medical emergencies). 
                                Supporting documentation (e.g., a doctorâ€™s note) may be required for such requests. 
                                Transfer requests must be submitted in writing to info@launchpadd.in within 7 days of enrollment . <br /> <br /><br />


                                <h5>4. Non-Refundable Items</h5> <br />

                                The following items are non-refundable under any circumstances: 
                                Payments made for downloadable resources (e.g., templates, guides, eBooks). 
                                Fees associated with third-party services (e.g., payment gateway charges).
                                Partial refunds for programs already accessed or partially completed. <br /><br /><br />


                                <h5>5. Changes to Programs</h5> <br />

                                In the unlikely event that Launchpadd cancels or significantly alters a program, participants will be offered: 
                                The option to transfer to another program or future cohort, or 
                                A credit toward a future program of equal value. <br /><br /> <br />


                                <h5>6. No Guarantees</h5> <br />

                                Participation in Launchpadd programs does not guarantee specific business outcomes or success. Our programs are designed to 
                                provide education, mentorship, and resources to help you grow as an entrepreneur. Refunds will not be issued based
                                on dissatisfaction with program results. <br /> <br /> <br />
